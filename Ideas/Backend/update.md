### Stockpile Resources
* Needs to update and either subtract or add based on ambient production and population usage
* Make a table with nation ids, and columns for every stockpile ambient production rate, as well as nation happiness. 
* Need a base production rate for every resource that is static, maybe government dependent, and multiply that base by the happiness dependent rate
* Update all user stockpiles.
